# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Example of drag-and-drap with [material table](https://material-table.com/#/docs/get-started) and [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

Based on this [Egghead course](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd).

## Notes

### JSX Error

In Visual Studio Code select a TypeScript version greater than 4.0.3, to resolve this error (see this create-react-app [issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/9868)):

    Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided.ts(17004)
